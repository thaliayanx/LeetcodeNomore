196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+

Solution 1

只需要先找到按邮箱分组的最小Id，

mysql> select * from Person;
+------+-------+
| id   | Email |
+------+-------+
|    1 | a     |
|    2 | a     |
|    3 | b     |
|    4 | b     |
|    5 | b     |
|    6 | c     |
+------+-------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select min(Id) from Person group by Email;
+---------+
| min(Id) |
+---------+
|       1 |
|       3 |
|       6 |
+---------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

然后删除这些不在最小Id的行即可。

mysql> delete from Person where Id not in (select min(Id) from Person group by Email);
ERROR 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause
可见，不能在from语句中出现需要待更新的表

我们可以把select min(Id) from Person group by Email生成一个临时表，然后再删除即可。

Code

delete p from Person as p
where p.Id not in 
(select Id from (select min(Person.Id) as Id from Person group by Person.Email) as ToRemovedId);
Solution 2

MYSQL的delete语句同样可以支持连接操作。先考虑select语句，需要查询重复的Email并且Id不是最小的。

mysql> select p1.Id, p1.Email from Person p1, Person p2 where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id;
+------+-------+
| Id   | Email |
+------+-------+
|    2 | a     |
|    4 | b     |
|    5 | b     |
|    5 | b     |
+------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
把select换成delete即可.

Code

delete p1 from Person p1, Person p2 where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id;
